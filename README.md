# Using AutoML and PyCaret for Data Analysis and Modelling

This is an assignment for CMPE 255 - Data Mining. 
The Assignment 1 folder will be where I have uploaded the results of the AutoML model hosted on JadBio.
In the Assignment 2 folder, I'll upload the python code using the PyCaret library to do various data science tasks.
